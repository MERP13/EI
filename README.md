# Flownaut

The Flownaut is a Web3/Cadence based wargame inspired by [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/) and is a branch of [Emerald Academy](https://academy.ecdao.org/en). 

Each level is a smart contract that needs to be 'hacked'. The game is 100% open source and all levels are contributions made by other players.

## Adding a Level
